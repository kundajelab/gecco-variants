First, run wit the default tolerances to identify matched negatives on the same chrom: 
generate_balanced_negative_set.py

For the SNPs that don't have matched negatives, look for matched negatives on other chromosomes: 
generate_balanced_negative_set_other_chroms.py  

For the SNPs that still don't have matched negatives, used reduced stringency tissue match metrics: 
generate_balanced_negative_set_other_chroms.py   --reduced_stringency 
also, relax maf & gc thresholds: 
maf_tolerance=0.05 
gc_tolerance=0.05
